#Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
---
 ## What are CNNs?
CNN is a special type of neural network which is based on the convolution operation. A generic CNN consists of a few types of layers: Conv (convolutional) layer, MaxPooling, Dropout, Activation, Flatten, and Dense. It is mainly used for image-based tasks, though they can be used in Audio Clasisfication and Natural Language Processing also. Over the years, a lot of research has been done to invent new architectures that are more optimised and suitable for various tasks, for example: ResNet, YoloV5, Xception, InceptionV3,etc.
